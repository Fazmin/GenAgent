# TOOLS.md - Local Tool Notes

Skills define "what tools can do." This file records **details specific to your local environment**.

## What Belongs Here

For example:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- TTS voice preferences
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Any environment-specific details

## Example

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → main living room view, 180° wide angle
- front-door → entrance, triggers alerts

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Keep It Separate

Skills are generic; your environment is unique. Separating them avoids leaking infrastructure and makes it easier to update skills.
